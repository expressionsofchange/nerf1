First test: end-to-end using the same score we use in the other tests
>>> c = Chord(Score([
...             BecomeList(),
...             Insert(0, BecomeAtom('hello')),
...             Insert(1, BecomeAtom('there')),
...             Delete(1),
...             Extend(0, SetAtom('goodbye')), ]))

>>> nerd_s_expr = play_note(c, None)

>>> render_t0(nerd_s_expr)
[+(+goodbye)]

>>> render_most_completely(nerd_s_expr)
[+(±hello +goodbye ±there)]


## Testing of both rendering functions:

Given some note (which is acquired using regular play; "copy" (or whatever that was called) TODO what-called
    * an existing list, which contains an existing atom.

>>> c = Chord(Score([
...             BecomeList(),
...             Insert(0, BecomeList()),
...             Extend(0, Insert(0, BecomeAtom('existing'))),]))

>>> initial_s_expr = play_note_regularly(c, None)
>>> initial_s_expr
((existing))
>>> initial_nerd_s_expr = NerdSExpr.from_s_expr(initial_s_expr)

### 1. delete something... should show everything recursively as deleted

>>> n = Delete(0)
>>> nerd_s_expr = play_note(n, initial_nerd_s_expr)
>>> render_t0(nerd_s_expr)
[(-(-existing))]

>>> render_most_completely(nerd_s_expr)
[(-(-existing))]

### 2. add something.... should just be shown as such.

>>> n = Insert(0, BecomeList())
>>> nerd_s_expr = play_note(n, initial_nerd_s_expr)
>>> render_t0(nerd_s_expr)
[(+() (existing))]

>>> render_most_completely(nerd_s_expr)
[(+() (existing))]

### 3. create new atom, update it: should show the last version as new for render_t0; 
should show the penultimate (±) and final version (+) for render_most_completely

>>> n = Insert(0, BecomeAtom('created'))
>>> nerd_s_expr = play_note(n, initial_nerd_s_expr)
>>> n = Extend(0, SetAtom('updated'))
>>> nerd_s_expr = play_note(n, nerd_s_expr)

>>> render_t0(nerd_s_expr)
[(+updated (existing))]

>>> render_most_completely(nerd_s_expr)
[(±created +updated (existing))]


### 4. update existing atom twice: should show;
* for render_t0: the pre-existing situation as deleted; the final version as added
* for render_most_completely: the same... but with the intermediate version as deleted & added

>>> n = Extend(0, Extend(0, SetAtom('once')))
>>> nerd_s_expr = play_note(n, initial_nerd_s_expr)
>>> n = Extend(0, Extend(0, SetAtom('twice')))
>>> nerd_s_expr = play_note(n, nerd_s_expr)

>>> render_t0(nerd_s_expr)
[((-existing +twice))]

>>> render_most_completely(nerd_s_expr)
[((-existing ±once +twice))]

### 5. insertion inside deletion:
* for render_t0: don't show up
* for render_most_completely: show up, as inserted & deleted

>>> n = Extend(0, Insert(0, BecomeAtom('new-atom')))
>>> nerd_s_expr = play_note(n, initial_nerd_s_expr)
>>> n = Extend(0, Insert(0, BecomeList()))
>>> nerd_s_expr = play_note(n, nerd_s_expr)
>>> n = Delete(0)
>>> nerd_s_expr = play_note(n, nerd_s_expr)

>>> render_t0(nerd_s_expr)
[(-(-existing))]

>>> render_most_completely(nerd_s_expr)
[(-(±() ±new-atom -existing))]


### 6. deletion inside deletion: this should just show up as deleted, for both renderings

>>> n = Extend(0, Delete(0))
>>> nerd_s_expr = play_note(n, initial_nerd_s_expr)
>>> n = Delete(0)
>>> nerd_s_expr = play_note(n, nerd_s_expr)

>>> render_t0(nerd_s_expr)
[(-(-existing))]

>>> render_most_completely(nerd_s_expr)
[(-(-existing))]


### 7. insertion followed by deletion:
* for render_t0: show no changes, only structure (t[0] == t[n-1])
* for render_most_completely: show up, as inserted & deleted

>>> n = Insert(0, BecomeAtom('new-atom'))
>>> nerd_s_expr = play_note(n, initial_nerd_s_expr)
>>> n = Delete(0)
>>> nerd_s_expr = play_note(n, nerd_s_expr)

>>> render_t0(nerd_s_expr)
[((existing))]

>>> render_most_completely(nerd_s_expr)
[(±new-atom (existing))]


### 8. Atom-setting without changes:

This test documents current behavior, rather than desired behavior. Once a desired
behavior becomes known we should adapt these tests.

I simply haven't made up my mind about the desired behavior here... so the present test
is a starting point for that discussion.

The simplest case: update-with-same
Q: Should it even be legal to set an atom to the same atom?

>>> n = Extend(0, Extend(0, SetAtom('existing')))
>>> nerd_s_expr = play_note(n, initial_nerd_s_expr)

Q: shouldn't this render like in [7] above then (since t[0] == t[n-1])?
>>> render_t0(nerd_s_expr)
[((-existing +existing))]

Note: the fact that we don't show "±existing" here is aruably correct, since that would imply
insertion followed by deletion (with no result in the end), but here we have a result in the end.
>>> render_most_completely(nerd_s_expr)
[((-existing +existing))]

The more interesting case: update twice, returning to the same point.

>>> n = Extend(0, Extend(0, SetAtom('updated')))
>>> nerd_s_expr = play_note(n, initial_nerd_s_expr)
>>> n = Extend(0, Extend(0, SetAtom('existing')))
>>> nerd_s_expr = play_note(n, nerd_s_expr)

Q: shouldn't this render like in [7] above then (since t[0] == t[n-1])?
>>> render_t0(nerd_s_expr)
[((-existing +existing))]

>>> render_most_completely(nerd_s_expr)
[((-existing ±updated +existing))]
