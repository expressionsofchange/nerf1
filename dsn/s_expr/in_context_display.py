"""
This module is part of the tooling to "show notes in some structural context". Which is to say: show to the user the
structural effects of playing one or more notes at t=0, t=1, t=2, ... t=n-1, given the structure at t=n-1.

Another intuition is: given some point in time ("present"), look at some preceding notes and show how those notes have
affected this "present".

We have 2 separate approaches for this, with varying amounts of information about what happened:

* render_t0 shows all notes that have affected the structure at t=n-1 as compared to t=0. That is: any note that could
be removed without changing the situation at t=n-1 is hidden. An example being: insertion inside a list that is later
deleted.

* render_most_completely shows all notes in some way; insertions without effects on the end-result are shown as both
inserted and deleted.

Note the following contrast:

* A NerdSExpr (from nerd.py) contains information (inserted, deleted) about what happened to that node in particular
* A InContextDisplay contains information on how to render a particular node's (inserted, deleted) status, including
    information that is implied by that node's context.

By the way: the name InContextDisplay is provisional (it's not very descriptive).

    An ICHAddress uniquely identifies a rendered "non-terminal" in the ic_history's rendering of history.

    Note that "In Context History", by design, shows a part of history (note) by showing the effects the application of
    the note has on a certain structure, and by using the rendering mechanism of that structure.

    This mixing of 'construction' and 'structure' is reflected in the address of the rendered elements; each rendered
    element is denoted first by the note which it represents, and second by an address (t_address, for stability over
    time) in the tree. (further steps in the rendering chain add further details, i.e. icd_specific and render_specific)
